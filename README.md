### Envato Tuts+ Course: Practical CSS: Build a Dropdown Menu
#### Instructor: [Adi Purdila](https://tutsplus.com/authors/)

One of the most common patterns in web design is a navbar with multi-level dropdown menu. While this is relatively simple to create, it’s still problematic for many developers — especially a CSS-only version. In this course, Tuts+ instructor Adi Purdila will show you how to code this component from scratch and share his tips and tricks along the way.

**Available on [Envato Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/courses) from November, 2017**
